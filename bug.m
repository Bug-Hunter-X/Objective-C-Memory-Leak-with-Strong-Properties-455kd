In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to properties declared without proper memory management attributes. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `myString` is later assigned nil or goes out of scope without a corresponding release or setting to nil, the application might leak memory and lead to crashes or performance degradation. The issue stems from the strong reference count maintained by the strong property attribute.  In this case, the string remains in memory even after it is no longer needed.  In larger applications, this can lead to significant memory leaks.
